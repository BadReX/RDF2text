While sequence-to-sequence models can be used to map the WebNLG RDF
data to sentences, a set of RDF triples can be viewed as a
graph. Recent work on other NLP task suggests that taking such
structural information into account improves performance
(marcheggiani-titov:2017:EMNLP2017,bastings-EtAl:2017:EMNLP2017). The
aim of this project is to explore an NLG model which represents the
input RDF triples as graphs using graph convolutional
networks. Implementations for Neural Machine Translation and Semantic
Role Labelling are available at:

The NLG-G task consists in adapting this code to generation and in 
training the adapted model on the WebNLG dataset.
